* windows with bigger size by default. So not need to make bigger each time you call the program or you show the expermient information

* button to come back to table from sequence figure?

* the information of the sequence can be together to the line? columnas t5/t3/add/mism 

* maybe we can add the position at the top of the plot. Like the first line being a scale

* if the information of the experiment is loadded at the same time than the search, we can put the sum(counts in experiment) next to each line (in the plot area), and even sort it by that number

# MORE WORK

* need to add to the plot the reference sequence, for that we will need to add that someway in some file. need the sequence and the positions .... or can trace one of the sequence there to construct the refence
