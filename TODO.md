* The plot can have a legend saying that NT is what color

* add to the plot the number of experiments where this sequence was detected, just next to where is counts now.

* add filter in the plot area to show only sequences with counts > VALUE or/and number of experiments > VALUE

* stay in plot if you use filter or order buttons, not jump to table
